We will integrate all the following seven components into a single integrated agent, which is called Rainbow!
1. DQN2.
2. Double DQN
3. Prioritized Experience Replay
4. Dueling Network
5. Noisy Network6.
6. Categorical DQN
7.  N-step Learning
This method shows an impressive performance on the Atari 2600 benchmark, both in terms of data efficiency and final performance.![rainbow](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14961526/60591412-61748100-9dd9-11e9-84fb-076c7a61fbab.png)
